<h4><a name="subject_1"><font color="#0000FF">1. What is new in
LigBuilder V3?</font></a></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  LigBuilder v1.0 first became available to the
public in September, 1999. Since then, we have registered
hundreds of users. As feedback, these users point out the bugs in
the program and also make all kinds of comments and
suggestion. All of these have been pushing us to go ahead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years past, we developed the new version: LigBuilder V2.
Besides bug-fixing, major improvements include: </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A new design strategy &quot;exploring mode&quot; was introduced to extend the original growing and linking design strategy. With the exploring mode, the program will explore the drug chemical space automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We use multi seed structures to generate the initial generation rather than single seed structures. Furthermore, an ensemble growing and linking algorithm was applied to put a lot of seed into competition to selecting the rational seeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Improved the score function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Developed a post recommender to refine design results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Developed an embedded synthesis analysis module to enhance the synthesis accessibility of design results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Much more user-friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another ten years past, we developed the new version: LigBuilder V3.
Besides bug-fixing, major improvements include: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Enable mutli-target design </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Learning from known inhibitor to  design mimic compounds</p>
<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Better controling for realizing user's intention of design</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Improved the score function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Interface for load external programs in generating compounds (for example, using other scoring funcion, ADMET rule etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Prepared fragments database based on known drugs and bio-active compounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Much more user-friendly. </p>

<h4><a name="subject_2"><font color="#0000FF">2. Can I use
LigBuilder V3 for DNA-based drug design?</font></a></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunatly, the answer is &quot;NO&quot;. Although
DNA-based drug design shares the same concepts with protein-based
drug design, there are two reasons preventing user from directly
applying LigBuilder V3 to such a project: (1) New parameters are
necessary for estimating the DNA-ligand interactions; (2) The
binding site of a DNA (minor groove) is more open than a protein
(usually a pocket), therefore the construction strategy may also
need to be adjusted. We may develope this function in next version.</p>

<h4><a name="subject_3"><font color="#0000FF">3. Why do I get empty output in a  job?</font></a></h4>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not so easy
to interpret, user may have to inspect step by step. The exploring mode is much more robust with immoderate parameters, but the growing mode and linking mode is very susceptible. T</font>he problem may be caused by (1) The defination of binding site, so user should check the ID of binding site detected by Cavity module, and also check whether the selected binding site is correct by visually inspection. If Cavity could not generated desired binding site, user may force Cavity to generate the binding site directly(refer to the section of Cavity) (2) Unreasonable requirement of design, for example, the required pKd should be less than 8 in most cases. Especially, if the maximal binding affinity of binding site predicted by Cavity is low, user should not set a high value for target pKd. (3) For the growing mode or linking mode, improper seed structure cause most troubles. (a) user should check whether the seed structure is checmial reasonable. (b) whetehr the seed structure is in the binding site, and no atoms are out of the surface defined by Cavity. (c) user should check the growing site on the seed structure, or user could set all hydrogen to be converted to growing site in the parameter file(d) LigBuilder will provide diagnose information if the seed structure violate structure parameters of design, and user may modify the seed or change the parameters. <span style="color: #FF0000">Notice: some parameters are loaded by INCLUDE keyword, so user should define parameters by adding it to your own input file. </span><span style="color: #FF0004">We are strongly discourage user to modify any input file in the default directory</span>. (4) the linking algorithm is more complicated than the
  growing algorithm. Linking between two separated structures will
  happen only when both conformation and chemistry are proper.
  Therefore, linking mode usually gives fewer results than growing mode does. Since
  the seed structures for linking may have no reasonable linkage between
  them can be made, because their positions or orientations are not
  &quot;proper&quot;. So if this does happen, please modify your
  seed structure. Leave enough space between each fragment is a
good idea. Besides, LigBuilder could use ensemble linking algorithm to select proper fragments for linking, so it is better to provide much more seed fragments to increase the possibility of success. (5) You could check the &quot;<span class="blue">active_TaskName.list</span>&quot; (e.g. active_1db4.list) to inspect the status of design, which may help you to find the reason. If you run LigBuilder in single CPU mode, you could check the status.lig file in result directory. (6) Please check whether the program is killed by system due to memory limitation. Using large fragment library or enable synthesis analysis will consume a lot of memory.<font color="#000000"> If the
    program still gives no result because of some mysterious reasons,
please let us know.</font></p>

<h4><a name="subject_4" id="subject_4"><font color="#0000FF">4. How can I
estimate the binding affinity of a single ligand molecule?</font></a></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you have noticed that LigBuilder V3
gives estimation of the binding affinities of the resultant
molecules. It does so by using the SCORE v4.0 algorithm. It is inherited from the SCORE series: <a
href="score.pdf">Wang, R.; Liu, L.; Lai, L.; Tang, Y.
&quot;SCORE: A new empirical method for estimating the binding
affinity of a protein-ligand complex&quot;, <em>J.Mol.Model</em>.,
<strong>1998</strong>, <em>4</em>, 379-394.</a> If you want to
estimate the binding affinity of a single ligand molecule to its
receptor protein, you may use the &quot;Score&quot; function of Build.</p>

<h4><a name="subject_5" id="subject_5"><font color="#0000FF">5. How can I
estimate the LogP value of a single molecule?</font></a></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LigBuilder V3 also estimates the octanol/water
partition coefficients of the resultant molecules. It does so by
using the XLOGP algorithm: <a href="xlogp2.pdf">Wang, R.; Gao,
Y.; Lai, L. &quot;Calculating partition coefficient by
atom-additive method&quot;, <em>Perspectives in Drug Design and
Discovery</em>, <strong>2000</strong>, <em>19</em>, 47-66</a>. If
you want to estimate the LogP value of a single molecule, you may
download the <font color="#FF0000">XLOGP</font> program from our
website <a href="http://mdl.ipc.pku.edu.cn/cgi-bin/down.cgi">http://mdl.ipc.pku.edu.cn/cgi-bin/down.cgi</a></p>

<h4><a name="subject_6" id="subject_6"><font color="#0000FF">6. How to use
LigBuilder V3 wisely?</font></a></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good question! </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LigBuilder V3 is a multiple-purposed
structure-based drug design program. It provides the abilities
for binding pocket analyzing, lead discovery, lead
optimization, mimic design, de novo design, multi-target design, molecule filter and synthesis analysis. The modularized function of LigBuilder V3 enhances
the flexibility in its application and the program provides a high degree of automatization to design molecules by one-stop process. Besides, it is very easy to
use --- the users like this so much.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, please remember: You'd better  not use it as
a black box although we try to   streamline  the design process; use it as an idea generator for instead. 
Especially when analyzing the final results given by LigBuilder V3,
we do believe that expertise is still very important. <font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
