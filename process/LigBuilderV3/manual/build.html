<h4><a NAME="subject_1"></a><font color="#0000FF">1. Introduction</font>
</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major function of Build is constructing
  ligand molecules for the target protein by applying the fragment-based design strategy.&nbsp;All the molecules are  developed and evolved
  with a Genetic Algorithm procedure. The synthesis accessibility of 
designed compounds can be analyzed with the aid of an 
embedded chemical reaction database and a retro-synthesis analyzer. Moreover, using a set of evaluation rules, ligands
can be designed to best fit the identified cavities. Drug-like and 
privileged fragments can be used to construct ligands with the aid
of internal and external absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) and drug-like filters. In
addition to these novel functions, Build inherited all the existing algorithms, features, and libraries used in GROW and LINK modules of LigBuilder 
v1.2. All resultant molecules will
be collected in a file and finally bring out a design report.  </p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please notice:</font><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Build rely on the binding-site describing file generated by CAVITY.
  Therefore, you should obtain the result of CAVITY first.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Although Build could be run in single CPU, we suggest user to run a number of Build processes simultaneously for accelerating, which helps to generate more compounds for further selection. The design speed will be linearly increasing with the number of processes. Furthermore, a &quot;pseudo parallel&quot; trick was applied by the Build in  automatic mode to simplify the operation. If running on a mainstream workstation, a design task could takes  20 to 10000 CPU hours depends on the case. The running time will increase  if the ligandability of
the binding site is much lower, or the users need much higher binding affinity. And de nove design may need more computational time, comparing with lead optimization mode. Attention: Build will consume a lot of memory, a typical Build process will use 1~2G memory, and user may control the memory consuming by loading different memory control parameter sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synopsis of running Build:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
color="#FF0000">build</font><font
color="#FF0000">&nbsp; -Function Parameter_file [Id]</font></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><span class="red">./build&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Automatic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build.input<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>./build&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-EXIT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build.input &nbsp;&nbsp;5</strong></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parameter file assembles all the
  information necessary to run Build as you wish. You should edit
  the parameter file before running Build. The key words appeared
in this parameter file are explained in the following.</p>

<h4><a NAME="subject_2" id="subject_13"></a><font color="#0000FF">2. Parameter sets</font></h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For convenience, we provide some default parameter sets to adapt different task, user may simply loaded them into your parameter file by the keyword &quot;<span class="blue">INCLUDE</span>&quot; . They are under the path &quot;<span class="blue">LigBuilderV3/default/</span>&quot;, including following default sets:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Overall default set:</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">default.input</span>: The overall default parameter set of Build. Including all default settings of Build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Default path:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">path.input</span>: The  default path of all input and output files. You'd better avoid from modifying them directly, because the matching file names are important for Build to run under automatic mode. User may set the path by setting the predefine name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Diversity set:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">diversity_low/moderate/high.input</span>: The  default sets of molecule diversity. Increase the diversity may decrease the synthesis-accessibility. Default: Low.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synthesize set:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">synthesize_knowledge/rapid/moderate/accurate.input</span>: The  default sets for balancing the synthesis speed and accuracy. The embedded retro-synthesis analyzer is extremely resource consuming if we do not constrain the analysis accuracy. According to our experience, a rough synthesis accessibility estimation go with the design process is much more effective than an accurate strategy. Although a rapid strategy will decrease the reliability of the estimation, we could dispel this affection by the post analysis based-on the huge amounts of the design results. Knowledge strategy will provide a basic estimation, and it is very useful if your computer resource is limited. Default: Rapid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Optimization set:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">optimize_none/soft/moderate/intense.input</span>: The  default sets of molecular optimization intension.  Default: Intense(Exploring), soft(Growing/Linking).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Memory control set: </strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">design-memory_500G/1G/2G.input</span>: The parameter set of maximal design memory. Increase the maximal memory to enhance the genetic algorithm. Default 1G/per session.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">synthesize-memory_600M/1G/2G.input</span>: The parameter set of maximal synthesis analysis memory (embedded analyzer). Increase the maximal memory to enhance the analysis speed. Default 1G/per session.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">analysis-memory_1G/2G/3G.input</span>: The parameter set of maximal synthesis analysis memory (post analyzer). Increase the maximal memory to enhance the analysis speed. Default 1G/per session.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="red">ATTENTION: The maximal memory of a session is equal to the summation of the design memory and synthesize memory of embedded analyzer (1st + 2nd term), or the maximal synthesis memory of post analyzer (3rd term). Please select appropriate memory allocation solution according to your system resource.</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Recommend set:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">recommend_redock/inclusiveness/moderate/exactness.input</span>: The  default sets of LigBuilder V3 recommender. Build will output a huge amount of molecules in a design task (1~10 Million molecules, typically), and the recommender will help you to select the most potential molecules. Recommender applied a dynamic estimation equation to refine a large molecules library based-on the statistic of molecules, hence it would not be used to process a small molecules set in the standard mode. Nonetheless, we provide some solutions to adapt special cases. User may try the 'moderate' or 'inclusiveness' set if the 'exactness' strategy failed. And if you want to apply recommender to refine the docking result, you may try the 'redock' set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Special design strategy set:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">lead.input</span>: The  default set of lead design mode. Design lead structure with low molecular weight and high atomic efficiency.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">mimic.input</span>: The  default set of mimic design mode. Design mimic inhibitor based on known inhibitors.(<span class="blue">Growing/Linking Mode</span>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Speedup strategy set: </strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">speedup.input</span>: If you have limited computing resources or you     want this work finished as soon as possible,      we strongly recommend you to use speedup strategy.     This strategy will lead to explore a smaller     chemical space, so it is much more efficient.     AND, this strategy has approximate design quality     but less diversity comparing with normal strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="red">Usersettings: </strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blue">usersettings.input</span>: User may configure your design strategy by setting this file.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a NAME="subject_3" id="subject_3"></a><font color="#0000FF">3. Basic parameters</font></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">DESIGN_MODE: </font>The central function of LigBuilder V3  is constructing ligand
molecules within the constraints of the target protein. LigBuilder V3 supports
three strategies to do this, i.e <span class="red">1</span><font color="#0000FF">: Growing strategy</font>, <span class="red">2</span><font color="#0000FF">: Linking strategy</font> and <span class="red">0</span><font color="#0000FF">: Exploring strategy</font>. To apply the growing
strategy, you need to provide a pre-placed "<font color="#0000FF">seed</font>"
structure inside the binding pocket and LigBuilder V3 will subsequently add
fragments onto it to build molecules. This strategy may be helpful when
you have got an interesting lead compound and want to develop its derivatives
to improve the bioactivity (<font color="#000000">lead optimization</font>).
To apply the linking strategy, you also need to provide a starting structure,
which consists of several separated chemical fragments. These fragments
should be pre-placed inside the binding pocket and would better to form
favorable interactions with the target protein. Then LigBuilder V3 will try
to build molecular frameworks to link those fragments into integrated molecules.
This strategy may be helpful when you try to find novel lead compounds
(<font color="#000000">lead discovery</font>). Furthermore, LigBuilder V3 provides a fragments extractor to extract &quot;seed&quot; from known inhibitors, and design molecules based-on these fragments.  This strategy may be helpful when you try to find mimic compounds. To apply the exploring strategy, the pre-placed seed structure is no longer needed. LigBuilder V3 will generate initial seed structure and extracting new seed structures automatically during the design process. This strategy is very powerful in design de novo scaffold and structures.

for growing mode and linking mode because the &quot;seed&quot; is the mother of all the resultant
molecules. Therefore, it will be ideal if the seed structure
holds the key features of the prospective ligands. LigBuilder
V3 could generate  seed structure
from known inhibitors by the &quot;<span class="blue">Extract</span>&quot; function, and the inhibitors should be docked well or extract from the crystal structure directly. For more instruction of how

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genetic algorithm parameters:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) to develop
  and evolve molecules. It is run under <font color="#0000FF">generational-replacement</font><font
color="#FF0000"> </font><font color="#000000">mode. </font>The
  rough procedure is like this: (1) Generate the initial population
  based on the seed structure; (2) Choosing &quot;parents&quot;
  molecules from the current population into the mating pool; (3)
  Copy the &quot;elite&quot; of the current population into the new
  population; (4) Fill out the new population by performing
  structural manipulations on the molecules in the mating pool. (5)
  Go to Step 2 until the pre-set number of generations has been
reached.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="ga_gr.gif" width="402" height="232"></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080">Flow chart of the GA
procedure implemented in Build</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, there are a few parameters for
setting up this GA procedure:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">NUMBER_OF_GENERATION:
</font><font color="#000000">Number of generations (GA circle) to
go through. Typically 8~15 generations will be enough.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">NUMBER_OF_POPULATION:
</font><font color="#000000">Size of the population. This
parameter determines dominatingly how much memory the program
will take while running. Usually it is several thousands.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">NUMBER_OF_PARENTS: </font><font
color="#000000">Number of molecules to be selected into the
mating pool. We recommend the ratio of NUMBER_OF_POPULATION /
NUMBER_OF_PARENTS should be larger than 10.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">SIMILARITY_CUTOFF: </font>Maximal
similarity between any two molecules in the mating pool. For
instance, if it is set to 1.00, it means duplicates are not
allowed to exist. By setting this parameter, you will exert a
forced diversity in the mating pool and thus are more likely to
get more diverse offspring. The lower this parameter is, the
higher diversity will be achieved. We recommend this parameter to
be 0.80~1.00.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">ELITISM_RATIO: </font><font
color="#000000">Percentage of &quot;elitism&quot;. </font>This
parameter could be between 0 and 1. For example, if it is set to
0.10, that means the top 10% of the current population will be
copied directly to the new population. By doing so, the elite
molecules will not lose by accident. We recommend this parameter
to be around 0.10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">GROWING_PROBABILITY</font>:
  For the current version of Build, growing manipulation is the
essential function. So please fix this parameter to 1.00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">LINKING_PROBABILITY</font>:
  For the current version of Build, linking manipulation is the
essential function. So please fix this parameter to 1.00.</p>
